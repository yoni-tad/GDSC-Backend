// ---------------------- NOde JS 2 ----------------------

/*
    Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications using a non-blocking, event-driven architecture.
    Node.js is not a framework, it's neither a programming language, it's a runtime environment used to run js outside of the browser.
    
    key components:
        Single-threaded event loop:
            Node.js operates on a single thread, managing multiple client requests with a event loop.
            The event loop handles asynchronous operations, ensuring non-blocking execution.
        V8 JS engine
            Developed by Google for Chrome, v8 compiles js directly to native machine code.
            Provide high performance and effecient execution js code.
            Parse and executes js code
    Node.js features
        Fast data streaming  
        No buffering
        Asynchronous 
        Cross platform compatibility
        Event driven
        Highly scalable
        Single threaded

    Even-Driven Architecture:
        Event loop
        Callbacks
        Event emitters

    Node.js execution flow:
        Initialization
        Event loop
        Event queue

    Blocking vs Non-blocking
        Blocking:
             
        Non: blocking

    Modules
        Modules are reusable pieces of code that encapsulate functionality.
        They help in organizing code into manageable sections.
        Node.js uses the CommonJS module system.

    NPM
        Node package manager is the default package manager for node.js
        its allow to install, share and manage dependencies for your projects.
    Using NPM
        Initializing a project:
            npm init -y
        Install packages
            npm install <package-name>
            example instal: express
        Update package
            npm update
        Uninstall packages
            npm uninstall <package-name>
